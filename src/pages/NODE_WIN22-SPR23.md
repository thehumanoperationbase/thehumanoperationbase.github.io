**JOIN PUBLICATION – 3BATCH//CLOSING WINTER22/23 – CLOSING SPRING 23**

**–Love–**

**Preamble:** – Whatever talents I possess may suddenly diminish or suddenly increase. I can with ease become an ordinary fool. I may be one now. But it doesn’t do to upset one’s own vanity. –

***– Dylan Marlais Thomas***

**in the name of those we do.**

Hereeverafter, Question being asked; if We, Human Beings of Earth, had to quantify a Planetary Economy, what would be the single key reference use to quantify? Intelligence?, Rarest Materials extracted or made?, the Ability of Human Beings to Imagine and Create?, or Human Nature of caring for one another, the very cement of Civilization. How something so seek after can elude Us this way? Of all things ‘Cognitive, Physical, Intellectual, Emotional Human Being’s commonly experience Love (in all ‘It’s’ definitions), without the shadow of a doubt the Experience every Human being will seek after, willingly or not from the living experience that is Life, for living Beings say Human to Human or for everything ‘thing’, the car paradox is the best example of ‘It’ for a thing. In the particular case of the Romantic aspect, the term “falls for” or “search for”, when misplace or unwanted ‘It’ can become the subject of conflict, wrongly given or misforgiven ‘It’ become the subject of Passion (‘It’ without the limitation of Taboo), from both ends of it, ‘It’ can’t be shared, too much of ‘It’ or opposite Absence open the door to unwanted Emotions and Feelings, curated or faked if ‘It’ is a Fiction from what this Fiction Emanate from? ‘It’ has been the center of interest for every Human Being’s from ‘creation’ until today. Has an Autonomous Automata ‘It’ is the subject of many Poems, Battles, Arrangement and any failed attempt to keep ‘It’ for oneself. Over a Life time ‘It’ will be experienced in so many forms and by All and every Human Being’s, if only ‘It’ could be shared, but ‘It’ can only be given, of course this works for anything Living and everything ‘thing’, and for whatever You give Your Love attention to ‘It’ will unleash energies of Cosmic forces most always concluding in unwanted consequences. ‘It’ is Love, the subject of attention for the NP’s Batch.#3/4.

Home Of Bohemian – The HOB – the I.O.C.P. is proposing a new publication format, moving gracefully from the RAW Publication to NODE PUBLISH, intersection of a singular momentum, ‘a’ continuity for Transcendence, but not at the expense of Knowledge, Art(s) & Sciences, hence the deliberate choice of more visual Works & Pieces, so this Third publication is featuring Researchers, Artists & Lecturers like Humanity only is able to produce, – Larry Arnn, Luisa Wawrzinek, Abigail Child, Jennifer Burton, Andrew Huberman, Gregg Braden, Brian Rose, Lauryn Hill Ms., AfterSkool/UnchartedX, the Collector, Richard Lindzen, Jordan B. Peterson, Angus Stone, Peter Salovey, Peter Brugger, Kirsten I. Taylor, Mitchell Leisen, Martin Brest, Mark Anthony “Baz” Luhrmann, Paul Verhoeven, Terrence McKenna, Banksy, Perspective, Sin Wai Kin, the Guggenheim Museum, Steve Bickley, the Clay Center, Kendra Cherry, Zick Rubin, Susan Kucera, Jeff Bridges, Brian Green, Karen Armstrong, Mark Watts & Alan Watts, Joyce Meyer, David Buss, Rupert Sheldrake, Crimson King, Philip Glass, Billy McFarland, and Mattew McConaughey on Lex Fridman PODCast, of all forms of Art Human can abide by, Conversation is without a doubt one of Human’s unique attribute, welcome to the NP’s #BATCH3//

**Intellection.**

Course correction, in Life and particularly the everything Limbic System Love or anything Emotion, all is very much business as usual; Humanity circa:21CE *fake it until You make it.* Apply Human disciplinary energy to correct Emotional Behaviors, redirect Affect attention and propose ‘It’ as a Survival Model, in Layman terms Intellection, *ɪntɪˈlɛkʃn, noun, the action or process of understanding, as opposed to imagination\\.*

Can we begin with conclusions? Is that how Human being’s experience the Consciousness of Love? By determining the conclusion, say vision, of what or whoever You so suddenly, or timelessly, be compelled to give all Your attention to! Or should we begin with a definition instead. What is Love? ‘It’ is defined as */1/a profound concern and affection for another person- /2/ In psychoanalysis, love may be equated with pleasure, particularly as it applies to the gratifying sexual experiences between individuals- /3/ an interest for Fetishism with regards to material and property.*

Would that mean that Love is a Human affair only! What with ‘the’ Love Humans have developed for Animal’s? How about anything immaterial, can ‘It’ be given to things? */1/Contrary to what we like to say and believe, the feeling of love doesn’t occur in our hearts, at least scientifically. Instead, it happens in our brain when we release hormones (oxytocin, dopamine, adrenaline, testosterone, estrogen, and vasopressin) that create a mix of feelings: euphoria, pleasure or bonding-.*

Does not mention ‘what’ create this Chemical reaction. Did science achieved better to define Love? To approach ‘It’ in any intellectual manner would only take us to what is already known. And in this Place and Time the ‘Word’ lay siege and the word is Humanity, the way We see each other and the way We see ourselves. Physiognomy, a ‘gilt’ Human Beings all sink into, relate and accelerate nowadays, so much so that any ‘fashion house’ (every one) nowadays has co-jointed into a single method to render (for lack of a better word) the visible more appreciable to the Cognitive Human Sense that is Eye Sight. The upcoming Summer publication will be a continuity of the HOB Publications with the Title: *“TransHumanist, in one word”* and will be the *NODE PUBLISH SUM23,* however, to set continuity to publication’s does not mean escaping what bounds Humans, hence the subject matter for this closing Season, Love as in, Human Being’s immerse into the Experience of Living Love.

**EXALTATION IN ITS PRIMER DEFINITION (TRANSCEND, ELEVATE, RISE…) EMPOWER EMOTIONAL MEMORY. AWAY FROM FEELINGS AND THEIR MANY COGNITIVE WAYS OF BEING EXPERIENCED. A FIRST TIME REPEATING OVER TIME WILL LOSE ITS EXALTATION EFFECTS & AFFECTS, CONVINCING US OF A NEED. BUT AGAIN, HOW WELL DOES ONE KNOW THYSELF TO DIFFERENTIATES LOVE FROM EXALTATION.**

On with the obvious, not so or always a Self-delectable experience. What Physiognomy has to do with Love? Physiognomy (a Pseudo-Science to some and a hard Science to others) is part of Human Beings daily lives, dissimulated into a ‘function’ inherited from Evolution (Social, Societal and others) ‘normalized’ by Globalization, Human Beings (anywhere on Earth) behavioral operation falls under 7 modes disregarding Phenotype or Cultural inheritance, Human Behavior is ‘THE’ Common Science of the 21CE, and very much like appreciation (the recognition and enjoyment of the good qualities of someone or something), Physiognomy has long now taken over the ‘ways’ Human’s ‘appreciate’ each other Visually with a ‘knowing’ better call it a ‘Individual Science’ to enable One to detect via the complex Human Emotional system shapes and forms from which emanate Compatible features to be transformed into Communication thus opening a Physical dimension “of love” only to abuse its contents. Very little is needed, as mention before in our Publications, You are Emotionally compromise.

## Jordan Peterson on the Larry Arnn Show – Psychology, Sexuality, and the AI Revolution –

**We are all so desperate for love that we keep on making false claims about it in every area of our lives. Why do we do this? What is it about love that is so important to us that we are willing to settle for fool’s gold to feel that we have got it?**

**A subtle reflection of Light.**

This publication is a reminder. A reminder of basics and foundations. How does Human’s perceive this World. Now, that would be a good start. Naturally we won’t ignore the multitude of other factors, Chemistry, Philosophy (every Human Being’s live and abide to one however incomprehensible that Philosophy of Life maybe), Intelligence of course a major attribute to how Love can be expressed, or Human Pro-Creation and the infinite capacity to Reproduce, and of course Death and a reminder that each and everyday Humanity is loosing Human Lings of all Ages and Their Branches extending as far as yours in Time(s), a conclusive end to Love.

We include the numerous Spiritual aspect of ‘It’, which factors can be access either by Will or Biology. Pheromone, one of the Biological attribute of attraction could be and his debated over again and again widely opening the door to a possible ‘Astral’ realm in which the actors would be Genetically paired and from which the results (say Procreation) would provide a foreseen result aka; an Identifiable Indivisible Individual, but then what to make of Love for ‘thing’ from which Pheromones does not emanates?

So, Human Sight’s (as in many ways to See) induce by a subtle reflection of Light, Photon is our starting point. How far from Love can this be You may ask, well, a Photon away we shall answer. The Human Intellect has a way to make some subject more accessible than others, which of course is to be differentiated from Intelligence itself, and that overall anything Humans do today is only to guaranty ‘a’ Tomorrow with a question mark, Human Brain cannot differentiates between Actual Reality & Imaginary Reality, hence the importance of Memory (which nowadays can be storer in Digital form) and how Visual Memory, Human very first Imaginary Sense, enter to play.

**Blind Love!**

How a blind Human Being Love? That question You will have to answer by Yourself, what we aim at here is the ‘blindness’ People interacting with other People & ‘things’, experiencing with the Willing & Conscious Act(s) yet rendered and transformed into Unconsciousness. Not to see is equal to blindness, the ability for Human Beings to ‘see what others mean’ feelings included (actual Telepathy) providing the capacity to ‘project’ and later ‘predict’ certain state of events, the said Willing Act(s) release an abondance of Hormones when Love is involved in the process, an altered state of consciousness. Predication and prediction! predication or prediction, predication of predictions, the prediction of predication? Confusing isn’t it, ‘set roles rules’, so what are the Eyes (Intelligent Emotions) which enable Us to See? There is 9 universally acknowledged family of Emotion in Human General Behavior, anger, surprise, disgust, enjoyment, fear, rage, nostalgia and sadness (Family because they last both in existence and experience and give birth to Act(s)), these nine state of Emotion which can be associated, differentiated and declined in over 25 categories reflecting in behaviors triggered by the Action(s) / Reaction(s) mechanism of Societal Humanity. The vast extend to which these ‘Prime’ Emotions drives Human’s are well known, from Experience or reported stories, but we have already lost the thread of Our search, about Love little if anything should be reminded, Eternal Love or as little as inattention to whom is in lack of ‘It’, either in demand or in expression, the lack of ‘It’ is undeniable nowadays and easy to See, both with Intellect or Emotions, hence the necessity to overcome the current state of Human affairs, but how to overcome a never ending Emotional machinery. Interjection is the word at play, the quest is the absolute understanding in real time of One Life! “better Love Your Life and less Your servitudes”, and as General Consciousness grow, each and every Human Groups found themselves immerse in a Reality that is nothing but, yet not Imaginary, modeled on the same foundation, but expressed in variations. Enter the blind-full dedication to Ideology (All of’hem), an artifice devoted to assert One Emotional ability, so many are proposed, Political, Religious, Industrials, Alternatives, Cultural, Spiritual and so on, which one will capture global attention of 8.4 Billion Human Beings all enabled to experience what Humanity story have produce, in real time.

*: Interjection*

*//An interjection is something you say which interrupts someone else who is speaking. In grammar, an interjection is a word or expression which you use to express a strong feeling such as surprise, pain, or horror.//*

**in Love with “our” servitudes –**

**LONDON REAL// Gregg Braden with Host Brian Rose.**

**systemic carelessness.**

Unlike anything else, which need to be maintained (long gone ‘sustained’ apply it to the everything system and it fail), Love demand very specific Human condition to emerge, be identify and lived to be remembered, Memory is indeed everything, imagine a reality in which Human Being would wake up not remembering their yesterday and conscious of it!?, once in the altered state of Emotion that Love is, One will look for it again and again, not building any precise form of memory but use each of the 3 main Memory strain to come to life, Neuroanatomical the ‘I am yours you are mine’ state or a Mental imprint which will resist alteration of time, Neurophysiological or the memory of what You are ‘loving’ and Psychological which is what You determine (choose, decide,…) as what You Love and not, including that sensory memory, short-term memory, and long-term memory will be expressed and experienced, but no Emotional memory of Love which You could trigger at any time to make You re-live the Emotional state of Love, the residual memories exist only in the Imagery Plain. Hence Our constant quest to create environments promoting the reproduction of already experienced ‘Love’. A point the HOB Platform keep attention to, how to experience and keep the ‘energy’ of what was experience as vivid as it was when experienced, disregarding the “what” Social, Economic, Health, Business, Politic, Religion or War all required a dimension of Love at the time of Act(s) and most often consequences carefully ignored only to be forgotten. Scenario repeated over and over again by any and all Human Societal Group anywhere on Earth, overpassing the search of safety and comfort, proposing for discomforting experiences in order to ‘evolve’. This ideology of evolution applied to “Love” explain so much, it is the Emotional base of how Human’s build on hierarchy over hierarchy, obsolete in face of Our Epoch, unfortunate Human cannot ‘decide’ what the risks are, only marly ‘decide’ to take those risks, Humans of Earth Sub-Consciousness is taking over. as such in Philosophy Love have distinct and well acknowledged ‘danger’;

*//”Love becomes dangerous in two instances: when harm and violence occur to the beloved and, even worse, when lovers exclude the people external to the relationship. Since love involves blindness, specifically to most things other than the beloved, the lover often cannot see the damage done to the others by isolation. Circumstances such as this are when love becomes [possessive and exclusionary, destructive and chaotic](https://web.archive.org/web/20250209042521/https://www.thecollector.com/sex-lives-roman-emperor/).”// from the Collector –*

“everything is everything”.

*Everything is everything. What is meant to be, will be. After winter, must come spring. Change, it comes eventually. I wrote these words for everyone who struggles in their youth. Who won’t accept deception, instead of what is truth. It seems we lose the game. Before we even start to play. Who made these rules? (Who made these rules?)
We’re so confused (We’re so confused). Easily led astray. Let me tell ya that Everything is everything. Everything is everything. After winter, must come spring. Everything is everything. I philosophy. Possibly speak tongues. Beat drum, Abyssinian, street Baptist. Rap this in fine linen, from the beginning. My practice extending across the atlas. I begat this. Flipping in the ghetto on a dirty mattress. You can’t match this rapper slash actress. More powerful than two Cleopatras. Bomb graffiti on the tomb of Nefertiti. MCs ain’t ready to take it to the Serengeti. My rhymes is heavy like the mind of sister Betty (Betty Shabazz). L-Boogie spars with stars and constellations. Then came down for a little conversation. Adjacent to the king, fear no human being. Roll with cherubins to Nassau Coliseum. Now hear this mixture, where Hip Hop meets scripture. Develop a negative into a positive picture. Now everything is everything. What is meant to be, will be. After winter, must come spring. Change, it comes eventually. Sometimes it seems. We’ll touch that dream. But things come slow or not at all. And the ones on top, won’t make it stop So convinced that they might fall. Let’s love ourselves and we can’t fail. To make a better situation. Tomorrow, our seeds will grow. All we need is dedication. Let me tell ya that everything is everything. Everything is everything. After winter, must come spring. Everything is everything. What is meant to be, will be. After winter, must come spring. Change, it comes eventually.//*

**The Organ of the Tale, Human Heart, is said to be the center of Love, many agrees and disagree about the meaning of it.

**CONSCIOUS LOVE**

Consciousness is something that you can share. It is something you know you are experiencing with others. Outerstatement? In this day and Age the ‘survival game’ is at all Societal level of this Humanity, and the price of this competition is People, the cost is in Humanity, this alone provide with a ‘comforting/confidence building’ course of action, but way before the distribution of challenges, the ‘goals’ are always defined fueling predation and opening all doors! Hence the need for Love, if the ‘demand’ is ‘made’ and balanced hypothetically, theoretically, virtually or co-jointly to the Natural Equilibrium, the demand created will never be match, only demand will remain. The best comparison we can come with is that of Cold-blooded animals, animals that are not capable of regulating their body’s temperature according to the temperature of the surrounding. The body temperature of these animals fluctuates as they move in different surroundings with different temperatures. Thus, they do not have a constant body temperature, it works the opposite way as well, Animals in need of constant temperature regulation (for Human regulated by the ECS) will adapt to constant and for a new line of adapted Animals, the adaptation is not reversible over time, so is ‘falling in Love’, irreversible, if Biology dictates, Humans are bound to the Consciousness of Love, a Biological Interjection to Human Imaginary.

If looked after from the Individual Transcendental experience, say one Human at a time and all together, the very first obstacle encountered by any Human Being stand in ‘formated view point’, nowadays expressed out in forms we can descried as ‘the mixing of typicality’, we develop on that subject in a RAW while publishing on Consciousness, Human like things (that include other Human’s) to look like what the imagery propose, example; Human like a car to look like a car, this projection is valid for everything the Human Eye can see, the interpretation is literal, physically related to an ‘image’ but operated by a contradiction, the best example which can be promoted for our present subject is that of the Human Love for adversity, and the ‘believes’ that an Action must be endured to fully grasp the experience, learn from it, and move on, “hierarchy’ even as part of a system such as this Humanity does not explain the structure prevailing over all other capability Human Beings have been granted with. TMK use to remind everyone about the hypothesis of the existence of Telepathy; *not some sort of way to read People Mind, but the ability to ‘see’ the meaning of their thoughts,* hence the importance to keep this Humanity Imagination in the best shape possible and limit alteration from any influence.

//case – ESP – Extra Sensory Perception –

Peter Brugger and Kirsten I. Taylor

//This paper consists of two parts. In the first, we discuss the neuropsychological correlates of belief in a ‘paranormal’ or magical causation of coincidences. In particular, we review experimental evidence demonstrating that believers in ESP and kindred forms of paranormal phenomena differ from disbelievers with respect to indices of sequential response production and semantic-associative processing. Not only do believers judge artificial coincidences as more ‘meaningful’ than disbelievers, they also more strongly suppress coincidental productions (i.e. repetitions) in their generation of random sequences. These findings illuminate the cognitive mechanisms underlying the formation and maintenance of paranormal beliefs for which the right cerebral hemisphere is hypothesized to

play a central role. These same right hemispheric semantic-associative processing characteristics are centrally implicated in the creative thought process as well as the genesis of delusional (pathological) beliefs (e.g. ideas of reference). The second part of the paper highlights how fundamental limitations in the concept of randomness constrain the analysis and interpretation of forced-choice

experiments in the field of parapsychology. Relevant proposals have periodically been forwarded during the past century (key names: Good fellow, Brown, Gatlin). These suggest that (1) as human subjects’ guesses are highly non-random and (2) as no finite sequence of target alternatives is free of bias, above-chance matching of guesses to targets simply reflects the amount of sequential information’s common to both target and guess sequences. The importance of such a non-causal model has been regularly downplayed by conservative parapsychologists, especially those who insist that ESP involves a transfer of information. Moreover, statistically significant relationships between guessing accuracy and personality factors and/or experimental manipulations most likely do not reflect a transfer of information, but are to be expected if subjects’ sequential response biases are systematically influenced by these same factors.// [READ AND RESEARCH HERE//](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222102208_ESP_Extra-Sensory_Perception_or_Effect_of_Subjective_Probability)

Reasoning along these lines, Shaver et al. (1988) hypothesized that people who were more secure with respect to attachment would be more likely than insecure people to provide effective care to a needy partner, because experiencing a sense of security is related to holding optimistic beliefs about distress management and maintaining a sense of self-efficacy when coping with distress. Furthermore, Shaver et al. (1988) hypothesized that attachment anxiety and avoidance would lead to different problems in caregiving. Specifically, avoidant people, who distance themselves from emotional partners and dismiss signals of need, should be less willing to feel compassionate toward a needy partner and less willing to provide care. In contrast, anxiously attached people, who seek closeness to romantic partners and are often preoccupied with their own needs, should react to others’ suffering with personal distress rather than empathy, which is likely to produce insensitive, intrusive, ineffective care.

**‘It’ Psychology.**

## Liking vs. Loving// FROM KENDRA CHERRY Exc/

In 1970, psychologist [Zick Rubin](https://www.verywellmind.com/rubins-scales-of-liking-and-loving-2795339) proposed an explanation for the difference between liking and loving.1 Sometimes we experience a great amount of appreciation and admiration for others. We enjoy spending time with a person and want to be around them. This is “liking,” according to Rubin, and doesn’t necessarily qualify as love.

Love is much deeper, more intense, and includes a strong desire for physical intimacy and contact. People who are “in like” enjoy each other’s company, while those who are “in love” care as much about the other person’s needs as they do their own.

Rubin believed that romantic love is made up of three elements:

> A close bond and dependent needs
> A predisposition to help
> Feelings of [exclusiveness](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-does-it-mean-to-be-in-an-exclusive-relationship-5202671) and absorption

Based on these elements, Rubin devised a questionnaire to assess a person’s attitudes toward others. He found that scales ranging from liking to loving provided support for his conception of love// [CONTINUE HERE](https://www.verywellmind.com/theories-of-love-2795341) //  [AND HERE](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329370762_The_New_Psychology_of_Love)

**when Plants cry.** – WIN2022/23 publication extract/

*Plants do not have vocal cords or lungs. Hadany says the current theory for how plants make noises centers on their xylem, the tubes that transport water and nutrients from their roots to their stems and leaves. Water in the the xylem is held together by surface tension, just like water sucked through a drinking straw. When an air bubble forms or breaks in the xylem, it might make a little popping noise; bubble formation is more likely during drought stress. But the exact mechanism requires further study, Hadany says.*

*The team produced a machine-learning model to deduce whether a plant had been cut or was water stressed from the sounds it made, with about 70% accuracy. This result suggests a possible role for the audio monitoring of plants in farming and horticulture.*

*To test the practicality of this approach, the team tried recording plants in a greenhouse. With the aid of a computer program trained to filter out background noise from wind and air-conditioning units, the plants could still be heard.*

With such a quote for an introduction to the Science of Love and diving into the ‘Factoring’ of ‘It’ and the required Science in motion to sale anything from jeans to cars to homes, the sublime phenomenon of Love is identify as the “must be included” component for any attempt to sale anything, unfortunately including Idea’s, hence the conundrum We are in, as a Humanity co-experiencing this Reality, enduring Systems within Systems manufactured by this Humanity to in an attempt to betterment, War included. So we ask ‘?’ What Conscious Entity operate by such tactic and systematic. Manufactured Consent on a Planetary level. And if you may ask, their will be no Transcendence without a Humane and Universal consent on Love, away from innovative notion which if not enough to be the cause of this Humanity lack of Attention has been the Poison of choice infused, so only consent required is that of a Participation, a ‘step’ closer to a Planetary Civilization and an Ethical Humane Society – *BE CONTROLED OR ENDURE DISCOMFORT, AND IF YOUR AIM IS AT COMFORT NO MATTER WHAT, YOU WILL DEVELOP A SURVIVAL MODEL BASE ON THE CONTROL OF OTHERS* – , how to solve this conundrum and move on gracefully as a Planetary Society, the Imaginary is not compromise as Our Emotional Beings, and Human Imagination is a powerful tool to foresee Humanity Future, with a common aim, that this ‘vision’ be maintain by All, Differentiation will be focus on Intents, and a new Learning process escaping Menticidal schemes and ready to endure Physical discomforts. Transcendence is near.

***//INNOVATION IS AN ALTERING POISON, IN THE BEST CASE SCENARIO AN ANTIDOTE WILL DEVELOP BUT THE HOST WILL NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN, IN WHAT WE CALL NORMALITY, INNOVATION KILL THE HOST. LOVE IS THE MOST HUMAN DEBATED SUBJECT AND THE PACE OF INNOVATION DICTATE DISTRIBUTION. RECENTLY HUMANITY AIM AT TRANSCENDING A PATTERN ENDANGERING HUMANITY TRANSITION TO A PLANETARY CIVILIZATION, WITH CREATION IN MIND, SOMETHING MADE FORM AND OF THIS TIME.//***

**‘the Wanting!’**

In the Adjective definition; lacking in a required or necessary quality.

“they weren’t **wanting in** confidence”// not existing; absent. “mandibles are wanting in many of these insects”// **INFORMAL** [deficient](https://www.google.com/search?q=deficient&si=AMnBZoFEI0LGJdD1jElhAGFwRnmoJyduDanTkdeW5vJ9DLjZTpoDlWFOkraSanCI3Z6SnfOduCM0_SklFlaFY8ZsmwpcB18oYw%3D%3D&expnd=1) in intelligence/, early 2016 HOB published 4 Seasons in a row about ‘ Synesthesis & the Alexitemia’, both of which are equally inert to the subject of Love, Love is transcending the All and the Everything Law(s). ‘the Wanting’, in opposition, is equally existing in All Humanity, and when addressing opposites always keep in Mind that ‘Absence’ is a possible for All. Confusing?, unclear?, or complex? Indeed, however ‘It’ persist, and “I want Love” is resonating from each and every Human Beings, ‘the Wanting’ is the echo. Want, in its abstract Definition;*to feel a need or a desire for; wish for: to want one’s dinner; always wanting something new. to wish, need, crave, demand, or desire (often followed by an infinitive): I want to see you. She wants to be notified. to be without or be deficient in: to want judgment; to want knowledge/,* and variants, *wants, wanted,* can be interpreted as the mirror of ‘the Wanting’, as very little of who or what is wanted conclude precisely as the imaginary & imagery defined it. Hence deceit, in all its power, ultimately generating ever more “want’s” and ultimately ever more ‘Wanting’, such is the fragile balance ‘It’ is embedded within Human lives, excluding any Spiritual or Emotional presence describe by Bruce Lipton .Phd as a parasite and can be interrupted by changes in Behavior and living environment. The absence of a ‘universal future vision’ provides with foreseen results and a quest, to Dream of Humanity again.

/As unromantic as it may sound, there is a formula for love. However, a vast amount of research remains to be done on the topic, and many aspects of the strong emotion that sweeps us off our feet are left to mystery// [READ & RESEARCH HERE/](https://council.science/current/blog/the-science-of-love/) 

WIRED

/Both scientists agreed that love is not something that can be controlled, curated or switched on or off. Instead, it arises from the depths of our subconscious. “Our subconscious mind has about ten times more information than our rational brain,” Toleikyte told WIRED. “So when we actually fall in love with a person it might seem like quite a momentary experience, however the brain is working really hard to compute and to produce that feeling// [READ & RESEARC HERE/](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/what-is-love)

**Absence.**

Well defined in modern Humanity like a ribbon imbedded in Human Story, now as then, at all Societal structural level (groups, casts, clans, etc). Presence would be the qualifying word, as in ‘absence of presence’; *In Human Beings the medical condition called coma is the only one known in which all consciousness is believed to be absent. In this state all voluntary mental activity is considered impossible. Even reflex functioning disappears and the individual cannot be wakened.* The non-existence or lack of the Present. This comes from the monolithic yet evolutive societal construct, abiding by what keeps Humanity in existence, from there strings of Philosophy the case of ‘existential risks’ revived by current Human affairs (say 1994 onward), exposes the ‘absences’ in consequential risks Naturally in existence or Human made distribution of responsibilities and lead to a Contemplation, this Humanity absence of Imaginary to Transcend is rooted in the very Survival guidance Humans of Planet Earth have developed over the Eon’s.

> The very Elements that made Us are Cosmic in Chemical qualities. So much to know, so little ‘Instructions’ on how “all this” function, could ‘It” be a ‘transferable knowledge’ as if explained in the best Cognitive understanding way possible by the most Able Humans in existence. Absence of Universal knowledge distribution? Instruction is key in a Human World in which ‘secrets’ are rules, {f this humanity function with the absence of love, could it function with the absence of secrets?}, nothing like ‘It’, as Aristotle saying goes; “Nature abhors a vacuum”.

**‘Honor among Thieves!’**

In Our Time(s), what is duly collected is kept and only rarely re-given, the hierarchy of possessions is at play, and in the absence of a known Planetary Civilization preceding Our Time(s), we will use regional examples, say any Civilization from Mesopotamia to anyone making Planet Earth today. Globalized by ‘standards’, Water, Shelter, Food, Health, Education, Transport and Communication in usage today is similar anywhere on Earth, a result of a continuity. Shouldn’t this ‘word’ and all ‘It’ implies be the queries of Our Lives? We wrote in the intro that we would end ‘It’ with a question, tainted with Affirmation, may it be the Love for the Art of Love, Art in ‘It’s’ Romantic definition, Artistry or the Human way to bring immaterial to physical, the Art of Living, Sex, Art even Martial ones, the Art of War, and all ways those are diffused among Human Society can easily be interpreted as predatory Action(s), in its definition; *the action or [offence](https://www.google.com/search?q=offence&si=AMnBZoFHF1DJLZWpTBtQDK262RMpN-AfGStlL6rkfuJLrP6om7TN6dOt48lx6nUzWSYsGZmrHgjakiO9sB4CCxOg0dJWnB7pcA%3D%3D&expnd=1) of taking another person’s property without permission or legal right and without [intending](https://www.google.com/search?q=offence&si=AMnBZoFHF1DJLZWpTBtQDK262RMpN-AfGStlL6rkfuJLrP6om7TN6dOt48lx6nUzWSYsGZmrHgjakiO9sB4CCxOg0dJWnB7pcA%3D%3D&expnd=1) to return it; theft/,* and to clarify the written statement we only have to oppose this statement to the existing and ongoing Societal Habits and Behaviors. Love, express in its opposite, Absence, universally.

*Christof Koch and Naotsugu Tsuchiya claim in a recent article* circa 2007  restricted access: [here](https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(07)00314-2)

*//”that ‘top-down attention and consciousness are distinct phenomena that need not occur together”//. To support this claim, they assemble evidence purportedly showing that (i) there can be consciousness without attention and (ii) there can be attention without consciousness. There is a fallacy in their argument for the second of these claims.* How unconscious of Love is this Humanity in great lack of attention. For as long as it can be remembered, ‘It’ is formatted and shaped throughout process’s and programs, involving any and all aspect of Human Life, no exceptions, no “dual mating strategy”, no “gestures or Words”, and no Law(s) to contradict it, Love can only be given.

In a willingly and consequences measured Intellection, Love in its general definition, may just be the subject of the theft, yet, as the quote goes, ‘Honor among Thieves’, Solidarity has a casual and usual consent is solidly embedded into Human Society, say this Humanity. A necessary arrangement for a Time(s) and a persisting Ritual disguised as ‘unintended obligation’, these words describe well Human state of Love 21CE.20, and without the shadow of a doubt the Path to Humanity Transcendence for a Future in total lack of consciousness and dire demand of attention, but yet again, words describing Life with an absence of definition on their own.
