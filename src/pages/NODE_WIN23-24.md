Salience of a Kind – NODE PUBLISH WIN23/24 | the Self, the Social, and the Metaphysical, what makes us unique.

It is our 3rd year, in 2020 Home Of Bohemian – The HOB – the I.O.C.P. proposed a new publication format, moving gracefully from the RAW Publication to NODE PUBLISH, and the celebration of a year (4 Seasons) which was nothing but dull Anxiety oblige, in this intersection of a singular momentum, ‘a’ continuity for Transcendence.
