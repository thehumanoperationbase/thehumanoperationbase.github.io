**Home Of Bohemian – the HOB – the I.O.C.P.//NODE PUBLISH**

### **AUT23#5BATCH//CLOSING AUTUMN 2023//**


***-what ‘the internet’ does best, propagating knowledge about “the subject of choice” worldwide-***

***-the Fall-*** *This ‘list’ is a compilation of key links to provide the readers with an organized and easy to access info-list related to the ongoing events, Earth, System Planet’s, The Sun Our Star, Our Galaxy, near Verse and observable Cosmos. The Fall is here, here is ‘the List’.*

**Preamble: // Conscious Neutrality;** /ˈkänSHəs/ CONSCRIRE Latin roots—the prefix com- (“with,” “together,” “jointly”) and the verb scire (“to know”), combined – conscire means “to be aware of” —and both relate to a state of awareness, the first of a moral awareness and the second of a physical or mental wakefulness. // – /no͞oˈtralədē/ Neutrality late 15c., neutralite, “neutral attitude or position” – “the neutral party in any dispute,” Medieval Latin neutralitatem (nominative neutralitas), from Latin neutralis see adj\\ -ei; is a State of Consciousness enabling One to understand and acknowledge that One does not hold the necessary information or data or Intuitivelly conclude that the said information’s and data’s are eroded or inaccurate and not withholding the ability to verify and certified such data’s and information’s to take a position or willingly engage in an activity. Conscious Neutrality.

**-Enternet-**

Conscious Neutrality! The correct ‘Stand’ to abide by, a State of conscious understanding opening One ability to foresee Life and accept not to be involved unless full transparency and complete sharing of knowledge is validated by the Common. !attention Seekers, Attention seekers. The quote is as simple it read, and it can be understood in any languages, “pay attention Seekers of the Living”, those who need Your attention knows how to get it.

‘Enternet’, we borrow the creative’s from Fletcher’s ‘Entergalactic’, the NODE PUBLISH first publication. attention Seekers! Attention seekers are here to take it away from You! *ONLY BY HOW EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCES CHANGES US* is enough to account for what can only be tagged ‘a multi consciousness’, the simple state of thoughts is a good example, at least it was until the WWW became what it is today, added to Books, various form of Arts and Human to Human living experiences, by now any Human’s at any given Time(s) can access the first ‘altered physical reality’ aka; this Humanity communication system. That is what the WWW the ‘backbone’, and the Internet ‘the access point’ is, a Planetary Civilization comm system, and it has been disruptive, so much so that none of the existing infrastructures of what makes the Human Safe Livable Zone, so the ‘existential risk’ to acknowledge is that of this Humanity Planetary Civilization in the making, the process of transition to transformation have already began, but a common vision is lacking, inspired from an external influence this ‘article of change’ is at Our doorstep and it came from Our own Galaxy distributing the Will of the Cosmos. By conscious Will Human Beings are presented with a Time(s) to transcend. Into what?, this Transcendental Epoch will show.

**‘the’ Lucid Dream if you like it better, but emanating from a ‘screen’.**

NODE PUBLISH AUT23 | Celebration, this Autumn closing takes Us to the Platform celebration of 30 years of WWW. So, to leave space in Mind for the subject of choice, only Music as we like it to support research, listening & reading, call it Down tempo, Low Fi, Trip Hop, Electro-Ska, Dubb, AM or chill out, from Classical Music to the far extend of Tribal Ritual Music this flow of Sounds emancipates Us All, this Year the HOB Artist is celebrated with Seven Beats Music aka; Haris Bajramovic.

On another hand, this publication aim at proposing a list of relevant publication, interview, podcast for matter of search, research, and directions about the coming of Age of a Transformation, by Will, this Cosmos is morphing in front of Our Eyes and this Humanity is conscious, it is Biologically experienced that this Humanity will take advantage from and Transcend, NODE PUBLISH AUT23 propose a list of studies and lecture about the ongoing subject of choice, fastening Cosmos, Galactic Wave & Earth Magnetic Excursion. Omission may have been made, we are asking Readers to add any link from ‘the Internet’ for others to access, just email us: [thehumanoperationbase@gmail.com](mailto:thehumanoperationbase@gmail.com) Good read, good listening and good search.

Awaiting for answers to unknown questions. How to answer the Living, how to answer Life. Lifestyle, the broad aspect of this Platform, have been a very revealing experience for those who have participated directly or not to Our developments, as the adage goes observation is good science, so we did just that, 30 years of WWW, 30 years for a digital web to deploy over a Planet, a Planetary Multimedia communication system, infrastructure and protocol, Asimov would be thoughtful. And in order to move on gracefully toward a Transcended Humanity, what We name Home, Planet Earth Human Life, must be morph, metamorphose should we write, and what is better known as ‘Spirituality’ put to use, consciousness is the path to transcendence, and in order to do so, the question of how to involve 8.079.000.000 (and counting) Salient, Sapient and Sentient Beings to Live. In Time(s) of Magnetic Excursion is the subject of choice, a changing reality in front of our eyes. NODE PUBLISH AUT23.

**Tasks & Bonuses**

Surviving. We re not here. This address Permanence and valuably its counter part, Impermanence. What we mean by that is that We are not able to foresee Our own Living (as a reminder it took 80 Human Birth for every 10000 Human to sustain the Human Species) pass a defined point involving a transcendence of a kind, Time(s), more Life=more Time(s). Tasks & Bonuses, for the last 3 years and unless you live above K10$/Year, You have at least heard of the ‘Internet’ revolving earning schematic demanding you to participate into ‘tasks’ usually a succession of click aim at resuming fault and deficiency in a System, Bonuses of course, come as a bargain, 30 cents a click and the gathering of Penny’s and Dimes provides just enough for a steady income of buying power. Food, Rental, Transportation, Care health and housing, Bills of all sorts starting by Your “internet” bill and nearly 5 Billion Human Beings inclusive of Elders, Adults, Teenager and Children find themselves under an understanding, one not define by needs and necessities, cultural obligation or religious contents, political inclination and military values, but an understanding that Their Live hangs on by an Optic Fiber cable! ‘what could go wrong’, and to make sure that You are aware of ‘the subject of choice’, In Time of Magnetic Excursion, 8.080.000.000 (and counting worldometer ) Human Beings in a state of conscious neutrality awaiting patiently the dawn of a vision, an imagery for All to contemplate and experience.

**-‘easy water?’**

Classical World of Physic – Reality as We experience it: EZ or exclusion zone, Is an ongoing discussion in the field of Sciences. Easy Water on another hand doesn’t mean anything, as human of Earth see Water as an ‘existing’ Element of Our day to day Life. Of All forms of what is tagged ‘Racism’, Intellectual Racism is emerging as the most relevant and lethal form of Mind using in Our becoming Planetary Civilization. At All strata of this Globalize World, the conviction that Intelligence is a 1 Dimensional realm aiming at reconstructing what it fail to achieve appears to be tainted with Tribal Pride & Clan Idealism, One could think of another term, ‘Fascism’ or again some would see here ‘Communism’ in all Political intent, and unless anything would be different on Religious ground (Religious Secularism are at work as these words are written) One could foresee a possible from what is in use by Human today on this Planet. But there is none, there is not and there is meant, existing construct Vs existing construct. We are at the Image of Ourselves, and We can’t accept it any longer.

What the Upcoming Geomagnetic Reversal Will Do to Earth

**-city weather-**

Of All things experienced by this Humanity, what is now known as ‘City Weather’ is been experienced by over 6 Billion Human Beings. So what is it that make this ‘Weather’ so Planetary? Maybe we should start on another dimension of thoughts, well timed if looking at this Planet of Human Workers, for some readers ‘those who don’t mind the weather and rarely see the skies’ representing 87% of the actual Population mass not involved on the ‘traditional’ Economy however gravitating around it for obvious survival reasons for the very basic necessities of living, Shelter, Food and Healthcare most of which inhabit Urban & near Urban areas. ‘City Weather’, a ‘Blade Runner like’ image, Pollution is the cause but blame it on ‘the weather’, climate echoes in everyone, from a possible to ‘the impossible’s’ soon to be known by All, in time Our Star, the Sun will have it It’s way, in our time the ongoing Magnetic Excursion of Earth hence the racing to automate and mechanize everything that isn’t, Human’s as well. Will the last necessary and by necessity Workers vanish without a fight? Away from all influenced ‘84’ and ‘brave new world’, these relics have inspired numerous of Individuals in search of attention, and a science has been developed to take away yours. Very much like City’s Weather, walled in and little to no light to see.

**The Space Junk Problem – EXTRACT//**

-Big messes call for big cleaning tools. When it comes to tidying up low Earth orbit, this isn’t a job for just anyone–or anything. Space debris come in all shapes and sizes, so they can be hard to pinpoint and even harder to capture. Leaving them to orbit around aimlessly, however, poses a huge threat.Let’s start at the very beginning. In 1978 NASA scientist Donald J. Kessler theorized that an increasing amount of space pollution would lead to more collisions between objects in orbit, and thus more debris. This became known as the Kessler Syndrome. This domino effect describes a cosmic crisis that is both massive and urgent. Luckily, multiple teams of researchers at USC Information Sciences Institute (ISI), a unit of the Viterbi School of Engineering, are working on solutions.

***EXTRACT//*** Many of the Earth’s biomes are under rapid assault or non-repairable changes that could lead to their destruction.

**Explanation:** As a result of the release of huge amounts of carbon gases being released into the atmosphere, the temperature of the earth is rising at a dangerous rate. This has the effect of raising land, air, and water temperatures and melting the polar ice caps.

This self-escalating trend is resulting in noticeable changes to every biome on earth. Warmer water is changing the habitats of marine animals, corals, jellyfish and fish causing unpleasant effects on [species](https://socratic.org/biology/the-elements-of-an-ecosystem/species) that can survive and those who cannot.

***Life.***

In summary, the human life cycle has six main stages: foetus, baby, child, adolescent, adult and elderly. Concluding with the state of Death, or the end of functions of all organs including the Brain.

***Life cycle of a Galaxy.***

In time, any given galaxy begins to run out of recyclable gas. Without gas, it can’t form new stars; the old stars live out their lives and die, and eventually the galaxy dies too. Galaxies sit in a bath of gas, the medium from which they were born and which fuels them.

***Cosmic cycle life span.***

Alternatively, according to theories of so-called cyclic cosmologies, the universe is immortal and is going through endless bounces. Although a bouncing universe may experience one or more cycles, a truly cyclic universe has no beginning and no end.

**The Imitation! Of being Intelligent?**

To begin, we should write that Intelligence is in the All and Everything, even functions, sometime ignored, but let it as it is today, say the everyday living of the everyone, aka: Human Beings of Planet Earth, and lets us pursue the thoughts of what is Our everyday living, repetition of tasks, set up of habits, development of guaranty???, all linked more to Our Salience & Sapience than Our Intelligence. So here is our question, ?are We imitating intelligence?, are We consciously say willingly creating an image of intelligence, amalgaming successions of seen and eared informations extending further Human Beings ability to survive under the act(s) of ‘working’. Entangled ways. This Humanity has no solution to extract value from ‘Love’, ‘in all human bourgeoisie’, Consciousnes or the search for the necessary tools to overcome Emotional discoveries, is taking grip, non participation organized under a social act demands attention, ‘eclectic’ is the Word. A Day to a Day, slowly making its path on anything Living, ‘the foreign element’ undiscribable in Human terms is fast becoming apparent.

**Tired to Fear!**

The ‘limits’ of the exchange can be described as follow; Hours of hard labor say physical labor, 10 hours a day every day, providing with most needed attention to the mechanical functions We All rely on but on which this Civilization in the making can’t accept, is poorly rewarded and has been for Eon’s (hello Roger, Sir) although this is not the focus of this paper it needed to be acknowledge, and Workers, women and Men, at it for these Eon’s claim the solid reality You are living in. This intensity of Labor build Human in a certain way, mental and Physical, down to it leaving very little ‘Hope’ for improvement, even over the long term, consistency become the ‘Immortal’ key, a Day to another Day. In the presence of a living example we are now emancipating and foreseen possible. Our choice, that of an RBE, propose that the Quant ‘start at the needed physical labor and what it demands in Human terms to achieve it, and demanding to identify first the Human Being’s willing to participate. It would demand concurrently that their Mental, Physical and Spiritual state of beings is attended, and finally the inclusion of ‘continuous learning’ would have to be made accessible meaning that learning programs will have to be adapted to the Dimensional functions of each student, learning the same things in different ways. The requirement of Shelter and Food along with Health attention would complete the exchange. Nothing un-eared of, all component exist at the exception of Will, difficult to find a realm to pour Will in, some say that the confusion is such that Humanity interest for itself is fading, Adorexia is becoming Human normality, not that anyone care, or that there is no interest in the living, everyone is just Tired to Fear.

Can Human consciously experience their Emotional Intelligence.

A Polluted Internal Environment at risk. Naturally we should acknowledge the impact on the Natural Environment however Human Beings suffer first from their own Act(s) of polluting a living space (for lack of better words) which enable Human’s to exist.

Our Star, ‘the Sun’, the regional space in Our Galaxy Our Solar system travel through ‘the Magellanic cloud’ itself a part of what is name ‘the Milky Way’ or Akash Ganga for Indu, *Darb Al-Tabbāna in Arabic, Млечный Путь for Russian or* 銀河 ‘Silver River’ in China which Galaxy is cruising at 1.3mMl/Hr or 2.1mKm/Hr in ‘a’ Cosmos which borders Human Beings can’t assert or see. This event is part of what Human describes as ‘Cycles’, not always with the idea that events unfold the same again and again, mroeso that at rather precise Epoch events of Galactic proportion unfold and happen to change greatly anything occupying its space.  If there is a Will behind it one may say that little is known about it at the exception of what Human Religions have gather over Time(s), and Human observation or Science enabling to foresee both what was and what could be.

It is important to remind the Reader of the timely opportunity this offer encompassing all and every similarities and differences making Human Society today as the concern is on the transformation of Human Beings from an external Agent, in Our case the nearest Agent being the Sun, Our Star, and in order to Transcend Human’s own Humanity is to be put at Work, opening to a Spiritual Transcendence.

**“CHBUF!?! It read ‘could have been used for’, and it juxtaposes the momentum this Humanity is in, this Platform has, have and will support the potential of a resources base Planetary economy, code tag @RBPE, it was difficult to avoid the talk when emphasizing the Transcendental potential of the moment, in Time(s) of Magnetic Excursion, would the interest for a few supersedes the potential of All?”**

**‘understanding? This isn’t about understanding, it is about Cell’s, Atom’s Particles awaiting a Will-full decision, nowadays every so call strategy from studies specially in augmented machines field ignore the BioChemical relationship, from a Host to a Host, for Human the very vibration of how we talk, what we talk and how we use language sequences to think form our reality. A vibrational reality’**

**Global Warming? Global Shift. Global Oscillation! & the Transcendence of a Kind**

The quest of a Planetary Civilization for another Star is an exalting Dream. To understand that, we should ask ‘what is a nightmare’, not so much in the Common term, everyone knows All Human’s have experienced it, for some too many times, \ nightmare is when 2 Dreams fuse resulting in a uncompromising effect, Chaos (yes Chaos and Anarchy are 2 of a kind), and to willingly ignore that Nightmare can enter the Living is to willingly ignore Human Nature, as We are not Projectors only one possibility remain, that We are Creators of Our Reality, by thoughts. In the case of the subject of choice, this HOB Publication would be missing a lot if the Work of Milankovitch to be ignored. Hey! Politic’s, Religion’s and Army’s aside, this Platform isn’t bound by none and nothing, so once again, ‘the List’ in order to be as complete as possible is to include the most willingly ignored a Human Being who have found out the ‘why,what.who & where’, aka: The Milankovitch cycles which includes The shape of Earth’s orbit, known as eccentricity; The angle Earth’s axis is tilted with respect to Earth’s orbital plane, known as obliquity; and. The direction Earth’s axis of rotation is pointed, known as precession. Who’s who:?: Galactic knowledge, a line extending from Earth’s North Pole slowly traces a large circle around the sky. It takes about 26,000 years to complete one Precessional cycle *“in 1000 B.C., ancient mariners such as the Phoenicians had no convenient pole star to use for navigation.”* Among other things, Milankovitch studied changes in these movements of the Earth, which alter the amount and location of solar radiation reaching the Earth. This is known as solar forcing (an example of radiative forcing). Milankovitch emphasized the changes experienced at 65° north due to the great amount of land at that latitude. Much to read and research on the subject of choice, but here the main key point to be aware of; Today, the Earth’s axis is tilted 23.5 degrees from the plane of its orbit around the sun. But this tilt changes. During a cycle that averages about 40,000 years, the tilt of the axis varies between 22.1 and 24.5 degrees. Because this tilt changes, the seasons as we know them can become **exaggerated.**

**ASOC – Altered State Of Consciousness**

*‘nothing new in the world of man but what is unknown’,* good quote, everybody laugh, such a disconcern, this Humanity ‘bourgeoisie’ is weighting the course of Time(s), choices over choices, deliberated decision after argued and agreed ‘discussions’ intellectually and willingly ignoring the affects and consequences inviting a ‘World of Human’ to participate without understanding or knowing what they participate to. Entanglement is the word. Year 2023 CE, Common Era, today, this moment in Your Life, how palpable and realistic it may seams, is demanding Living without the burden of the ‘survival process’, very much like the subject of choice WIN/SPR22/23 “It – Love”, ‘in Time(s) of Excursion’ aim to provide the Reader with hints and basics that a ‘World of Human’ experiencing the Living on a Planet name Earth are soon to realize that ‘reality’ just ain’t so. We live Our Lives in an altered state of consciousness, 99% of the time! Not so easy to accept for most, endured by few, and this sentiment is eperienced by All, is there an answer to Consciousness outside of Awareness?

**In an understanding with the Bios.**

You may have noticed it, or not, Our connection to the Bios (anything Earth) is expanding Consciousness included or Awareness incubated, and Our Senses fell that it happen exponentially from a day to a day. Many are ‘sheilding’ a very natural Biological reaction and do so without knowing they do, Our Biome works in such a way that a lot of ‘protection’ capacity just work on auto pilot, its built in Human’s. Transformation is the Word, a process by which ‘something becomes something else’, how. Why, where or who is than easy to grasp. Earth of Human’s and a Time(s) to Transcend, this publication aim at disseminating information’s of the subject of choice, in an understanding with the BIOS.

**“if the best reference we use to define what is a human being is solely on aesthetic, uni-dimensional intellect and ability to gather under ideologically elected groups, then we may be missing a lot. For now we stand between impossibilities and exaggeration, with no imagination of where we can go or what we can be.”**

**‘piaece of Mind’.**

We enter Winter once again, in the Southern Emisphere Summer start, This Planet is Our Home because of how We have transcended by ways of adaptation Millenia’s over, to write that it will always be so depends on Transcendental structure more than any other or how this Humanity can foresee its near Future, Transcendental structure that this Humanity is to Imagine. Nature demands it. What will becomes of Us maybe already known by some, ignore by others and a quest for most. The ‘phenomena of existence’ is experienced everyday, independently and collectively, lame in its content the ‘quote’ will make more and more sense as We collectively goes further into the observable Galactic Wave as its effects and affects are already at play on Earth. All the tools are available only the will to Be seams lacking, positively so Minds are transforming, the permutation is visible a Day to a Day, this Humanity is about to transcend, into what is unknown even by those instructed on the ongoing events, and this Humanity will look at the Sky once more and transform under the influence of a Cosmos which every Human have consciousness of, it is palpable, an invisible form of presence known as Magnetism is gently carrying in a Wind of transformation, and Human’s will Transcend from it, a Universal Consciousness for a Planetary Civilization.
